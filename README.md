# moon-lander

Use UP to turn the engine on and LEFT/RIGHT to rotate the spacecraft. Touch the ground at a low speed to win or hit it hard to explode. Passing the edge of the screen will move you to the other side of the screen. 

This lander game supports a LEAP Motion where hand roll on the right hand controls roll thrusting while a closed fist activates the engine. It is difficult, but before adding the HUD it was maybe impossible.
